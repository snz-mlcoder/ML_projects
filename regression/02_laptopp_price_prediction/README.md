##  Overview

This project performs:

-  **Data Preprocessing** and cleaning in Jupyter Notebook
-  **Model Training** with 5 regression algorithms:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - AdaBoost Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
-  **Visualization** of model performance (Actual vs Predicted)
-  **Interactive Streamlit App** for live price prediction
